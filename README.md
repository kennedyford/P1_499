<h1> P1_499</h1>

This repository houses the Final Project for CSC 499 - Introduction to Web Programming at Louisiana Tech University. For this project, we had to create a fictional web-based casino. We were required to create two seperate games for the casino, and we were required to create 'tokens' that were used to play the games. This token was to be updated and carried over to all of the web pages. For our two games, we chose a slot machine and blackjack. This was a group project and the two team members who worked on this were Joshua Bailey and Kennedy Ford.
